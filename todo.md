To-Do List: Building the Personal Finance and Investment Insights App
This to-do list outlines the tasks to develop a single-user SaaS app for personal finance management, including file uploads (OFX, CSV, QIF), Xero-style reconciliation, Supabase storage, a dashboard with budgeting and savings goals, Grok 3-driven insights, and a Money Trends page for investment education and market tracking.

Phase 1: Backend Setup and File Parsing
Objective

accounts (id, name, type)
transactions (id, account_id, date, description, amount, category_id, reconciled, tags, notes)
categories (id, name, is_custom)
budgets (id, category_id, amount, period)
goals (id, name, target_amount, current_amount, deadline)
Enable row-level security (RLS) with basic policies.
Add indexes on transactions.date, transactions.account_id.
Implement OFX Parsing
Install ofxparse library.
Write function to extract account name, date, description, amount, transaction type, ID.
Handle multi-account OFX files.
Save parsed data to Supabase transactions and accounts.
Implement CSV/QIF Parsing

Write functions to parse CSV/QIF with flexible column mapping.
Validate data and handle errors (e.g., missing headers).
Save to Supabase, reusing OFX logic.
Create File Upload API
Build FastAPI endpoint: POST /upload.
Accept multipart file uploads (OFX, CSV, QIF).
Call parsing functions and return success/error response.
Test File Parsing
Obtain sample OFX/CSV/QIF files (user-provided or synthetic).
Write unit tests for parsing logic using pytest.
Test edge cases (e.g., missing fields, invalid dates).
Verify data in Supabase.

Phase 2: Reconciliation and Frontend Setup
Objective
Build reconciliation logic with ML-based categorization and create a Xero-inspired React frontend.
Tasks
Set Up React Frontend
Initialize React project with Vite or Create React App.
Install Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, React-Table, Dropzone.js.
Set up routing with React Router.
Commit to Git.
Implement Reconciliation API
Create endpoints:
GET /transactions (filter by date, category, reconciled).
PUT /transactions/{id} (update category, reconciled, notes, tags).
POST /transactions/split (split amount across categories).
Add rule-based auto-reconciliation (e.g., "Amazon → Shopping").
Store rules in Supabase rules table.
Add ML Category Suggestions
Install scikit-learn.
Train simple model (e.g., Naive Bayes) on transaction descriptions.
Create endpoint: GET /transactions/suggestions.
Return category probabilities (e.g., "Walmart: 90% Groceries").
Build Reconciliation UI
Create ReconciliationTable component with React-Table.
Display columns: date, description, amount, category, reconciled.
Add filters (date range, category) and bulk actions.
Implement category dropdown and split transaction modal.
Style with Tailwind (Xero-like: blue/white, clean).
Integrate File Upload UI
Create UploadPage component with Dropzone.js.
Support OFX/CSV/QIF uploads.
Add CSV/QIF column mapping UI (e.g., select "date" column).
Show success/error messages.
Test Reconciliation
Write frontend tests with Jest/Testing Library.
Test API endpoints with Postman or pytest.
Verify ML suggestions with sample data.
Ensure UI updates after reconciliation.

Phase 3: Dashboard and Budgets
Objective
Develop a dashboard with spending charts, budgets, and savings goals.
Tasks
Implement Dashboard API
Create endpoints:
GET /dashboard/summary (balances, unreconciled count).
GET /dashboard/spending (category breakdown, trends).
GET /dashboard/budgets (category limits, progress).
GET /dashboard/goals (savings targets, progress).
Aggregate data from Supabase transactions, budgets, goals.
Build Dashboard UI
Create DashboardPage component.
Add charts with Chart.js:
Pie: Spending by category.
Line: Monthly spending vs. income.
Bar: Cash flow.
Gauge: Goal progress.
Display metrics (balances, top categories).
Style with Tailwind (Xero-like).
Add Budgets and Goals
Create endpoints:
POST /budgets (set category limit).
POST /goals (set savings target).
PUT /budgets/{id}, PUT /goals/{id} (update).
Build UI components:
Budget form (category, amount, monthly).
Goal form (name, target, deadline).
Show alerts for budget overruns.
Test Dashboard
Test API responses for accuracy.
Verify chart rendering with sample data.
Check budget/goal CRUD operations.

Phase 4: Grok 3 and Money Trends
Objective
Integrate Grok 3 for insights and build the Money Trends page with tutorials and market tracking.
Tasks
Set Up Grok 3 Integration
Obtain xAI API key.
Install HTTP client (e.g., httpx).
Create endpoint: POST /insights.
Send transaction summaries to Grok 3.
Parse responses for spending/debt/investment tips.
Build Chatbot UI
Create Chatbot component (floating widget).
Allow queries (e.g., "How to save?").
Display Grok 3 responses with markdown support.
Style with Tailwind.
Implement Market Data APIs
Sign up for Alpha Vantage, CoinGecko, Kitco APIs.
Create endpoint: GET /markets (stocks, crypto, gold).
Cache responses in Supabase or Redis.
Store watchlist in Supabase watchlist table.
Build Money Trends UI
Create MoneyTrendsPage with split-pane layout.
Left pane: Tutorials (markdown files, beginner-level).
Right pane: Watchlist and Chart.js charts (daily/weekly).
Add simulation tool (e.g., "$1,000 in Bitcoin last year").
Implement watchlist CRUD.
Add Tutorial Progression
Track user interactions (e.g., tutorial views) in Supabase.
Serve intermediate tutorials after repeated beginner views.
Use Grok 3 for dynamic investment tips.
Test Grok 3 and Money Trends
Verify Grok 3 insights (e.g., "Cut alcohol: save $300").
Test market API reliability.
Check tutorial rendering and progression.
Validate simulations with historical data.

Phase 5: Polish and Launch
Objective
Optimize performance, test thoroughly, and deploy the MVP.
Tasks
Optimize Performance
Add caching for market API calls.
Optimize Supabase queries (e.g., limit rows).
Lazy-load charts in React.
Compress assets (images, JS bundles).
Test End-to-End
Test full user flow: upload → reconcile → dashboard → trends.
Verify mobile responsiveness.
Check security (e.g., input sanitization, HTTPS).
Fix bugs from testing.
Deploy Backend
Deploy FastAPI to Vercel or Render.
Set up environment variables (Supabase, API keys).
Verify API endpoints in production.
Deploy Frontend
Deploy React app to Netlify or Vercel.
Configure CORS for backend API.
Test UI in production.
Document Usage
Write README with setup instructions.
Create user guide (e.g., how to upload files, reconcile).
Share with user for feedback.

Notes
Priorities: Focus on file uploads and reconciliation to enable early finance tracking.
Dependencies: Sample OFX/CSV/QIF files needed for testing parsing (Task 7).
Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust parsing logic if OFX files have quirks.
Post-MVP: Consider direct bank feeds, multi-user support, or compliance for future iterations.
